# Before we begin...

We'll need some data to work with! Let's all collaborate on building a recipe index. In this folder you will find a file called `recipes.json` with a few recipes in it. I want you to add your own!

## First, merge the main branch

1. checkout your personal branch
1. `git pull` (just to make sure you're up to date with your merged assignments)
1. `git merge origin main` (this should pull a bunch of stuff from main into your branch)
1. Let me or Adesoji know if this causes any problems for you!

## Add a recipe

Make a new branch called `<your name>-recipe`. Open the shared `recipes.json` file and add a recipe to it. You will NOT be copying this file into your code folder, you will change it right here where it is!

> Remember your JSON syntax! Double quotes only, and no trailing commas.

When you are done, open a new pull request to add your recipe to our shared json file.
