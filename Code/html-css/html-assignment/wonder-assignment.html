    <h1>The Crying Stone of Illesi, Kakamega</h1>
        <p class ="class">Crying has always been thought to be a phenomenon exclusive to human beings. 
        This is not the case for inanimate objects except for one special stone that can only be found in Kenya, specifically in Kakamega County, The Crying Stone of Illesi

     <h2 style="color: black; padding: 0;" > Why does the stone cry?</h2>  
     <p class ="class" style="color: black;">
         Legend has it that it was once a happily married man. He had no troubles, and, therefore, no reason to cry. One day, the man woke up to discover that his beloved wife had left him for another man. 
         His heart was broken, and he wept inconsolably. Ever since that tragic day, the man has been waiting for his wife to return, but as she never has. So, he stands alone on the side of the road, weeping, with no one to comfort him. Eventually, he turned into a rock, but his tears continued to flow, earning him the name, The Crying Stone of Illesi.
