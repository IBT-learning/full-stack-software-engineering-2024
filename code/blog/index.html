                <p class="content">
                  Running solo can definitely have its moments of zen, but
                  there’s nothing quite like having a buddy by your side when
                  the going gets tough. Having that support system makes such a
                  difference. When it’s just you, it’s easy to start making
                  excuses and wanting to bail. But when you know someone’s
                  counting on you to show up, it’s a whole other story. Plus, a
                  little healthy competition never hurt anyone – having someone
                  to push you to go that extra mile or pick up the pace can
                  really work wonders.

                <h3>Training In the Heat Is Good For You</h3>
                <p class="content">
                  As someone who’s been there, I can tell you that training in
                  the heat isn’t just about being a glutton for punishment. Over
                  time, it really helps your body adapt to those high
                  temperatures. You start sweating more efficiently, your blood
                  plasma volume increases, and you might even start to actually
                  enjoy it – or at least, be able to tolerate it without feeling
                  like you’re gonna pass out every time. It’s all about building
                  up that heat tolerance. Your body gets smarter and better at
                  handling the scorching weather. Sure, it’s not always fun in
                  the moment, but trust me, it pays off in the long run. You’ll
                  be able to push yourself harder, for longer, without feeling
                  like you’re gonna melt.

                <h3>The Best All-Round Men’s and Women’s Trail Shoes</h3>
                <p class="content">
                  The HOKA Speedgoat 5 is quite frankly, a masterpiece of trail
                  running engineering when it comes to combining, comfort with
                  performance and style. Named for Karl Meltzer aka “The
                  Speedgoat”, who holds the record for the most 100-mile ultra
                  trail race wins and epitomizes the “go everywhere, run
                  everything” attitude, these trail running shoes are designed
                  to attack all kinds of technical trails and are the best trail
                  running shoes right now; they’re also one of HOKA’s top
                  performing running shoes I’ve tested.

                <h3>Best Calorie Counting App</h3>
                <p class="content">
                  #MyFitnessPal -This app has made it to the top of the list
                  simply because it has a food database that includes 3,282,000
                  different food types. When you need to keep track of the
                  calories you’re consuming, you’ll want a quick and easy food
                  database that you can reference. You’ll be able to setup your
                  own digital diary for counting calories without having to
                  resort to self-reporting that never seems to work. This app is
                  also extremely flexible. If you’re like me, you like to try
                  different foods and eat out at different restaurants all the
                  time. You’ll need this kind of app if you love food, love
                  eating but don’t love the weight gain that comes with it!

                <h3>The 50k - a long marathon, or a short ultra?</h3>
                <p class="content">
                  As I swallow a handful of ibuprofen and exchange stories with
                  the other racers (Troy congratulated nearly every racer who
                  finished), I've concluded a few things. First, the ultra is a
                  very different animal than the marathon and under races. One
                  shouldn't think of it as a "marathon plus", but instead give
                  it the respect it deserves as a full-blown endurance event.
                  Second, I still have a lot to learn about the pacing and
                  mental game of the ultra. The "fast walk" is a crucial skill
                  as well, and one that should be practiced. Troy and many of
                  the others ran a very consistent race end-to-end, and were
                  fully aware of their capabilities along the way. I've got some
                  practicing to do, but I have no doubt I will be trying another
                  50k....or maybe a 50 miler....let the addiction begin...

                <h3>Shin Splints</h3>
                <p class="content">
                  If your shins feel like they are on fire when you walk to the
                  coffee pot, or run to the end of the driveway, there’s a
                  chance you’ve got shin splints. When your muscles and tissues
                  get overused, they become inflamed and irritated. This
                  inflammation can come from an increase in volume, improper
                  fitting or worn out shoes (lack of or too much support), and
                  weak or imbalanced muscles. This is also common in track
                  athletes due to the repetitive directional pull of the same
                  muscles. Rest up. Gently massage your shins and apply ice for
                  10-15 minutes a few times per day to ease the inflammation.
                  Stretch your ankles and shins by rotating your foot in circles
                  while pressing your toes into the ground with your shoes on
                  before and after activity.
