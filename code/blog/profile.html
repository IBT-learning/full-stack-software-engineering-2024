              <h3>Run with Friends</h3>
              <p class="content">
                Running solo can definitely have its moments of zen, but there’s
                nothing quite like having a buddy by your side when the going
                gets tough. Having that support system makes such a difference.
                When it’s just you, it’s easy to start making excuses and
                wanting to bail. But when you know someone’s counting on you to
                show up, it’s a whole other story. Plus, a little healthy
                competition never hurt anyone – having someone to push you to go
                that extra mile or pick up the pace can really work wonders.

              <h3>The 50k - a long marathon, or a short ultra?</h3>
              <p class="content">
                As I swallow a handful of ibuprofen and exchange stories with
                the other racers (Troy congratulated nearly every racer who
                finished), I've concluded a few things. First, the ultra is a
                very different animal than the marathon and under races. One
                shouldn't think of it as a "marathon plus", but instead give it
                the respect it deserves as a full-blown endurance event. Second,
                I still have a lot to learn about the pacing and mental game of
                the ultra. The "fast walk" is a crucial skill as well, and one
                that should be practiced. Troy and many of the others ran a very
                consistent race end-to-end, and were fully aware of their
                capabilities along the way. I've got some practicing to do, but
                I have no doubt I will be trying another 50k....or maybe a 50
                miler....let the addiction begin...
