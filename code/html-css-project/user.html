                        Meditation is a practice in which an individual uses a technique 
                        such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, 
                        thought, or activity  to train attention and awareness, and achieve
                         a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.

                        Are you fitting in at least 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of heart-pumping
                        physical activity per week? If not, you’re not alone. Only about one 
                        in five adults and teens get enough exercise to maintain good health.
                        Being more active can help all people think, feel and sleep better and
                        perform daily tasks more easily. And if you’re sedentary, sitting less
                        is a great place to start.

                        While meditation can help you manage stress, sleep well and feel better, 
                        it shouldn’t replace lifestyle changes such as eating healthier, managing 
                        your weight, and getting regular physical activity.
