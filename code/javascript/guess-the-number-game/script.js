// How the game works
// Before starting to code this project, please find a partner and play
// this game together verbally for a few rounds.

// Alice thinks of a number
// Bob guesses a number
// Alice says "higher", "lower", or "correct"
// repeat 2 & 3 until Bob guesses correctly
// After you get a feel for the game, it's time to write a software
// version of the game, where the human thinks of a number between 1
// and 100 and the computer tries to guess it.

// Coding the game
// You will complete this project in a JavaScript file that you will
// run in the browser, via an HTML file. Get input from the user
// using prompt() and send messages to the user using alert()

// You will need to use loops and conditionals to make this program work.
// Technically you could complete it without any functions, but I strongly
// recommend using functions to keep your code tidy and organized.

// Gameplay will work like this:

// ask the user to choose a number between 1 and 100

// ask the user something like "is the number higher than,
// lower than, or exactly 50?"
// continue asking that question, but modify the number
// based on their previous answers
// when the user says you got the number right, end the game
// The best way to narrow down your guesses is by
// using the binary sort algorithm. This Khan Academy
// article explains the algorithm and gives a useful visualization.

// Tips
// to save the player (and you) from typing too much, offer
// the user the option to answer h (for higher),
// l (for lower), or c for correct
// off-by-one errors are a risk here. Double check
// the distinction betweens "greater than" and
// "greater than or equal to", and "less than"
// and "less than or equal to"
// sign reversal errors are also a common mistake.
// Make sure you're not using > when you should
// be using <, and vice versa
// when you feel like your game is close to ready,
// ask someone to play it. Watching them play is a
// great way to spot bugs, poor UX, and other issues
// with the program

// Extra challenges
// keep track of the number of guesses we needed,
// and display a message with that number at the end of the game
// handle invalid/unexpected inputs from the user
// when the game is over, ask the user if they want
// to play again, and if so play another round.
// (Hint: this requires a while loop.)
// write a version of the game in which the computer
// chooses the number, the user guesses numbers,
// and the computer answers whether the guess is higher or lower
// if you finish that and want more, make the program
// start by giving the user a choice between the two games,
// and then start the game they ask for
// ... and then ask again at the end of each round

// Create greeting and welcome user
let firstName = prompt("What is your name?").toLowerCase();
firstName = firstName.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + firstName.slice(1);
