// Guess The Number
// How the game works
// Before starting to code this project, please find a partner and play this game together verbally for a few rounds.

// Alice thinks of a number
// Bob guesses a number
// Alice says "higher", "lower", or "correct"
// repeat 2 & 3 until Bob guesses correctly
// After you get a feel for the game, it's time to write a software version of the game, where the human thinks of a number between 1 and 100 and the computer tries to guess it.

// Coding the game
// You will complete this project in a JavaScript file that you will run in the browser, via an HTML file. Get input from the user using prompt() and send messages to the user using alert()

// You will need to use loops and conditionals to make this program work. Technically you could complete it without any functions, but I strongly recommend using functions to keep your code tidy and organized.

// Gameplay will work like this:

// ask the user to choose a number between 1 and 100
// ask the user something like "is the number higher than, lower than, or exactly 50?"
// continue asking that question, but modify the number based on their previous answers
// when the user says you got the number right, end the game
// The best way to narrow down your guesses is by using the binary sort algorithm. This Khan Academy article explains the algorithm and gives a useful visualization.

// Tips
// to save the player (and you) from typing too much, offer the user the option to answer h (for higher), l (for lower), or c for correct
// off-by-one errors are a risk here. Double check the distinction betweens "greater than" and "greater than or equal to", and "less than" and "less than or equal to"
// sign reversal errors are also a common mistake. Make sure you're not using > when you should be using <, and vice versa
// when you feel like your game is close to ready, ask someone to play it. Watching them play is a great way to spot bugs, poor UX, and other issues with the program
// Extra challenges
// keep track of the number of guesses we needed, and display a message with that number at the end of the game
// handle invalid/unexpected inputs from the user
// when the game is over, ask the user if they want to play again, and if so play another round. (Hint: this requires a while loop.)
// write a version of the game in which the computer chooses the number, the user guesses numbers, and the computer answers whether the guess is higher or lower
// if you finish that and want more, make the program start by giving the user a choice between the two games, and then start the game they ask for
// ... and then ask again at the end of each round
