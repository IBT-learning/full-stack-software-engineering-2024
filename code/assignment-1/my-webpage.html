            <h3>A cultural festival that fosters trans-border relation between nigeria and benin republic</h3>
            <p>The Gaani festival is an annual event that takes place among the baruten people of kwara state, nigeria 
            and their tribemen in the benin republic. the baruten people originated from the old borgu kingdom in the 
            kingdom of benin republic headquatered in Nikki town before the colonial era which saw some of the people 
            migrated from benin to nigeria. in nigeria they are mostly found in the baruten local government area and
            kaiamah local government area of kwara state. they are also found in some part of niger state 
            as they form the fourth largest ethnic group in Niger state called the morgu tribe.<br>The annual Gaani 
            festival brings together everybody in the local government areas. Both men and women, old and young 
            participated in the activities irrespective of their ideological differences, class diversity and religious
            affinity.<br>
            It commenced in Kaiama on January 12 reaching its climax seven days later (January 19) with exquisite 
            cultural displays from various groups within and outside the state.<br>
            The annual festival which holds in the lunar month of Rabiu-Awwal every year is to commemorate the birth
            of Prophet Muhammad (SAW).<br>
            Historically, Gaani is also considered a feast in honour of departed monarchs and ancestors who reportedly
            initiated the festival over 300 years ago. All the children from the royal families both the Princes and 
            Princesses come out to shave there hairs in order for them to be given traditional titles.<br>
            During the festival, princes come to receive the king and their ancestors, whose spirits are believed to 
            enter the royal drums reserved for the occasion. In addition, the festival is organised to appease the 
            spirits of their ancestors for sparing their lives to witness yet another festival.
