Second, I still have a lot to learn about the pacing and mental game of the ultra. The 'fast walk' is a crucial skill as well, and one that should be practiced. Troy and many of the others ran a very consistent race end-to-end, and were fully aware of their capabilities along the way. I've got some practicing to do, but I have no doubt I will be trying another 50k....or maybe a 50 miler....let the addiction begin...",
