            I live in Hartbeespoort Dam, which is an arch type dam situated in
            the North West Province of South Africa. It lies in a valley to the
            south of the Magaliesberg mountain range and north of the
            Witwatersberg mountain range, about 35 kilometres north west of
            Johannesburg and 20 kilometres west of Pretoria. <br />
            I have created some interesting facts about this area below.

          Hartbeespoort Dam is situated within a mountian range called
          Magaliesberg, which is designated as the
          <i>Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site</i>. This is where Mrs.
          Ples was discovered by Robert Broom and John T. Robinson on April 18,
          1947.
          <br />
          <br />
          Mrs. Ples is the popular nickname for the most complete skull of an
          Australopithecus africanus ever found in South Africa. Many
          Australopithecus fossils have been found near Sterkfontein, about 40
          kilometres (25 mi) northwest of Johannesburg.
          <br />
          <br />
          Because of Broom's use of dynamite and pickaxe while excavating, Mrs.
          Ples's skull was blown into pieces and some fragments are missing.
          Nonetheless, Mrs./Mr. Ples is one of the most "perfect" pre-human
          skulls ever found. The skull is currently held at the Ditsong National
          Museum of Natural History in Pretoria.

          <h2>The Wonder Cave</h2>
          <p>
            The WonderCave in Kromdraai, Gauteng, South Africa is situated
            within the Bothongo Rhino & Lion Nature Reserve in the Cradle of
            Humankind, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
            <br />
            <br />
            The cave is the third-largest cave chamber in the country. It is
            5-10 million years old. The single chamber has an area of 46,000
            square metres (500,000 sq ft), and is 125 by 154 metres (410 by 505
            ft). It was discovered in the late nineteenth century by miners who
            dynamited and excavated limestone for the making of cement.
            <br />
            <br />
            Mining stopped during the Second Boer War and never resumed. The
            cave has about 14 stalactite and stalagmite formations up to 15
            metres high, 85% of which are still growing. The 60-metre-deep cave
            is accessible to visitors by elevator.

            The construction of the dam officially started in August 1916.
            Initially, work was delayed pending a court judgment with General
            Hendrik Schoeman and a certain Mr. Marshevin about the expropriation
            of their properties. The dispute was later resolved but discontent
            remained after a hastily passed law to facilitate the expropriation.
            In his book "Agter die Magalies", Bertus de Beer argues that the
            government acted in a heavy-handed manner to resolve a number of
            issues surrounding the construction of the dam. Mother Nature caused
            further delays due to flooding. In 1914 and again in 1918, huge
            amounts of construction wood washed down the river and were never
            recovered. During 1915, the wall of the Geldenhuysdam further up the
            river broke and the flooding of the site also caused a delay.
