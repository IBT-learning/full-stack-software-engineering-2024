# HTML Assignment #1

Make a web page about something you think is cool or interesting. It could be a historic site, cultural event, person, place, a book or movie, or even something from your own life. It can be as personal or impersonal as you like, but I would enjoy learning something about your home region.

This is not a research project, feel free to copy and paste content from other websites such as wikipedia (but make sure to remove footnotes, etc.)

So far we have learned limited styling options, so keep the design clean and simple with complementary colors. Remember that margins and padding, text size, and border placement are all important considerations for a visually pleasing design.

Remember to check the appearance of your page at different widths to see the impact of element wrapping.

### This is your webpage, it can look however you want it to. It **should not** have the same layout, content, or colors as the example page. Get creative!

#### Style requirements:

-   set a background color for the page
-   set a different background color for at least one area of the page
-   change the color of some or all links

-   remove the underline from links
-   set a maximum width for one or more elements
