    <p>Ashenda is named after the long, thin "Ashenda" grass which girls tie to hang down from their waists in a fashionable pattern. The Ashenda grass has come to symbolize the religious festival, as dancing girls move their waists causing the leaves to shake in an eye-catching manner. The festival is also called "Shadey", "Maria", "Aynewari", "Ashendye", "Solel", and "Engicha".</p>

	<h3>The Story of Ashenda</h3>
    <p>Ashenda is an annual Amhara and Tigrayan festival which celebrates women and girls. It's believed to have originated in Lalibela region of Amhara Region, scholars estimate it began around 400 AD. The festival takes place in August and mainly celebrated in Lalibela and has been adopted in bordering regions of Ethiopia . Amhara & tigrayan women living throughout the world try to make it to Lalibela, Mekelle or in their respective village where the Ashenda festival takes place. Only women participate in the celebration while the men mostly play the role of gifter in some cases protectors from potential harassment as the younger girls travel door to door singing Ashenda songs and receiving gift like money, traditional food made for the festival. The festival comes after the two weeks of Filseta. During Filseta, people fast, or do not eat, through the day. Filseta and Ashenda honor the Virgin Mary. In the festival, young women and girls wear white cotton dresses. These dresses have colorful embroidery, called tilfi. They also wear a lot of jewelry. They weave ashenda grass into a bunch, and wear it where on their backs, or as a skirt. Ashenda, in the Tigrinya language, is a tall green grass that grows on river banks. Girls often wear five cornrow braids in their hair. They wear Kohl eyeliner. </p>
    <p>On the first day, the girls gather at the middle of the town or village. Then they break up into groups, and walk through the town. They sing and dance for the people in every house, and also in the village square. The people in each house give them money, food, drinks, or other gifts. The women and girls give these gifts to poor people. They sing and dance all day until sunset. This festival may last for a week or more.
