                    If the automobile had followed the same development cycle as
                    the computer, a Rolls-Royce would today cost $100, get a
                    million miles per gallon, and explode once a year, killing
                    everyone inside. (Robert X. Cringely) For a long time it
                    puzzled me how something so expensive, so leading edge,
                    could be so useless. And then it occurred to me that a
                    computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do
                    incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are
                    smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid
                    things. They are, in short, a perfect match. (Bill Bryson)
                    Java is, in many ways, C++-. (Michael Feldman)

                    They have computers, and they may have other weapons of mass
                    destruction. (Janet Reno) The cheapest, fastest, and most
                    reliable components are those that aren't there. (Gordon
                    Bell) Everything that can be invented has been invented.
                    (Charles H. Duell, Commissioner, U.S. Office of Patents,
                    1899) First, solve the problem. Then, write the code. (John
                    Johnson)

                    I've finally learned what 'upward compatible' means. It
                    means we get to keep all our old mistakes. (Dennie van
                    Tassel) It is not about bits, bytes and protocols, but
                    profits, losses and margins. (Lou Gerstner) The best thing
                    about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off
                    by a bit. (Anonymous)

                    I think there's a world market for about 5 computers.
                    (Thomas J. Watson, Chairman of the Board, IBM, circa 1948)
                    The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what
                    a programmer is doing until it's too late. (Seymour Cray)
                    Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers, it
                    makes products difficult to plan, build and test, it
                    introduces security challenges, and it causes end-user and
                    administrator frustration. (Ray Ozzie) The only people who
                    have anything to fear from free software are those whose
                    products are worth even less. (David Emery)

                    If McDonalds were run like a software company, one out of
                    every hundred Big Macs would give you food poisoning, and
                    the response would be, 'We're sorry, here's a coupon for two
                    more.' (Mark Minasi) It has been said that the great
                    scientific disciplines are examples of giants standing on
                    the shoulders of other giants. It has also been said that
                    the software industry is an example of midgets standing on
                    the toes of other midgets. (Alan Cooper) There are two ways
                    of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so
                    simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the
                    other way is to make it so complicated that there are no
                    obvious deficiencies. (C.A.R. Hoare)
