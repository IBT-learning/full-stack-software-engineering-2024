# React Final Project: Blog client

This is it, the time has come! It's time to rewrite the front-end of your blog as a React app. You should be able to reuse some of the HTML and most of the CSS you already wrote, though obviously it will need to be restructured into JSX.

This is _your_ blog site that will serve as _your_ portfolio piece in your job search, so I'm not going to set rules on what you have to include, or how you have to structure it. Add as much functionality as you can, and make it look as nice as you can.

You have no obligation to adhere to anything you wrote in the past. If you find that you need or want to adjust your data models, endpoints, CSS, or anything else from previous versions of the app, please do! In fact you will probably _need_ to make at least a few adjustments.

Have fun, and good luck!
