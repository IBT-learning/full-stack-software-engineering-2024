# JavaScript Assignment #4: Loops

You may do these challenges all together in one file, or in separate files, according to your preference. You will turn them in all together.

## Challenge #1

-   Paste this line into your code:
    -   `const wordList = ["every", "word", "in", "this", "array", "should", "be", "capitalized"]`
-   Write a for..of loop that logs each word in the array
-   Now, within the loop, capitalize each word

#### Extra challenges (you may any or all or none of these)

-   (this is actually a strings challenge) Try capitalizing only the first letter. There is no string method that does this, so you will need to utilize `.slice()`
-   Rather than simply logging each word in the array, try creating a new array and adding each capitalized word to it
-   Add each capitalized word to a string instead of (or in addition to) an array

## Challenge #2

-   Write a loop that will execute exactly 10 times. You can do this with either a while loop or a "classic" for loop
-   For each loop, console log whether the number is divisible by 3. (You can do this with modulo)
    -   you will need a conditional inside your loop for this!
    -   you can log "true" and "false", or if you prefer, "yes" and "no"

#### Extra challenges

-   Solve FizzBuzz without looking up a solution! This is one of the classic beginning programming challenges
-   [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is an explanation of the children's math game FizzBuzz
-   Write a JS loop that will go 40 times, and for each number console log the number, and either Fizz, Buzz, or FizzBuzz next to it
-   Be mindful of the order of your conditions!
