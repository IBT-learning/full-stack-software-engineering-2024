# JavaScript Assignment #1: Strings and Numbers

In this assignment you will perform some basic operations and `console.log()` the results.

Create a new file inside your code folder for this assignment. You will run your code using `node <your-file-path>.js`. Remember that the path to your file is always relative to your working directory!

You may do these challenges all together in one file, or in separate files, according to your preference. You will turn them in all together.

### Strings

-   Create a constant variable and assign it a _string literal_ with your name
-   Console log the _length_ of the string
-   Console log the _string template_ "Hello, my name is \_\_\_\_" but fill in the blank with the name variable.
-   Console log the _string template_ "When my friends see me they shout \_\_\_\_!" but fill in the blank with your name in all caps. (Use a string method to capitalize it!)

### Numbers

#### Challenge 1:

-   Create a constant variable with a number in it. (You can choose any number, with any number of digits.)
-   Multiply the number by 2
-   Add 8
-   Divide by 2
-   Subtract the original number
-   Console log the result
-   The result should be 4

Tips:

-   You can use any number of variables to do this, but you only need one or two!
-   If you choose to combine operations within a single line, don't forget about mathematical order of operations

#### Challenge 2:

-   Find the area of a circle with a given radius (), rounded to four digits
-   Console log the result

Tips:

-   A radius of 2 should give you 12.5664, and a radius of 3 should give you 28.2743
-   Don't forget about order of operations!
