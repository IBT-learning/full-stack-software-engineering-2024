# JavaScript Notes

### Expressions

[MDN Docs on Expressions and Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_operators)

A JS expression is a piece of code that resolves to a value. Every operation creates a new value, which can then be passed to other operations, on and on. Each operation is one expression, and the new value is that is created is what the expression resolves to. Expressions can be complex and include other expressions within them.

An expression "ends" when it is assigned to a variable, or it reaches the endpoint of the operation (such as logging to the console.)
