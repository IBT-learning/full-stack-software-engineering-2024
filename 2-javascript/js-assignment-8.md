# JavaScript Assignment #8: Callbacks

You will complete all of these challenges in the same file.

## Challenge #1: Practice .filter()

- Make an array with the numbers 1 - 10
- Use `.filter()` to create an array with only numbers that are larger than 7
- Use `.filter()` to create an array with only numbers that are even
- Use `.filter()` to create an array with only numbers that are divisible by 3

## Challenge #2: Practice .map()

Using that same array with number 1-10

- Use `.map()` to create an array with the square of each number (such as `[1, 4, 9, 16...]`)
- Use `.map()` to create an array with each number halved (such as `[0.5, 1, 1.5...]`)

## Challenge #3: Using .filter() to filter objects

Start by pasting this into your code:

```javascript
const prices = [
  { product: "shoes", price: 50, inStock: true },
  { product: "light bulb", price: 3, inStock: true },
  { product: "stuffed animal", price: 15, inStock: false },
  { product: "jacket", price: 75, inStock: false },
  { product: "keychain", price: 4, inStock: true },
];
```

- Use `.filter()` to create an array with only the product objects that cost less than $20
- Use `.filter()` to create an array with only the product objects that are in stock
- Use `.filter()` to create an array with only the product objects that are in stock AND cost less than $20

## Challenge #4: Using .map() to map objects

- We're having a sale! Use `.map()` to create an array with all the same objects, but with the prices reduced by 25%
- The sale is only for products that cost more than $10. Rewrite the previous map to only change the prices for items with prices above $10.
- We're making an ad for the sale. Make an array of strings that read, for example, "shoes are on sale for only $37.50!"

#### Extra challenges

- Can you use `.reduce()` to join all the strings from the previous together into one long string?
