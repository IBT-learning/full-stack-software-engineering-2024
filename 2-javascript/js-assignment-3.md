# JavaScript Assignment #3: Conditionals

You may do these challenges all together in one file, or in separate files, according to your preference. You will turn them in all together.

## Challenge #1

-   Create a constant variable called `movieTitle` and assign it a string with the title of a movie you like
-   Create a constant variable called `isScary` and assign it either `true` or `false`
-   Create a constant variable called `isRomantic` and assign it either `true` or `false`
-   Write a conditional statement that will log _only one_ of these sentences to the console:
    -   this movie is both romantic and scary!
    -   this movie is romantic
    -   this movie is scary
    -   this movie is neither romantic nor scary
-   In each outcome, replace "this movie" with the title of your movie.
-   TIP: try out assigning the boolean variable to different values of `true` and `false` to make sure all of the conditions work correctly

#### Extra challenge

-   Add another variable `isFunny` and see if you can represent all possible combinations
-   Note that this adds a significant number of new options! Can you figure out how to solve it with nested conditionals? (Putting conditional statements inside of other conditionals?)
