# JavaScript Data Types

## Primitive types

A primitive type stores a single value. It is not an object, and has no properties or methods. There are exactly 7 primitive types:

-   string
-   number (including NaN)
-   boolean
-   null
-   undefined
-   bigint (we'll never use these)
-   symbol (we'll never use these)

Though each data point has no properties or methods, the type itself has properties and methods which we can use to read or manipulate the data.

## Reference types

Reference types store references to collections of data, rather than single data points.

There are a basically unlimited number of reference types, which are all, under the hood, different implementations of a JS object. The reference types we are most likely to see and use are:

-   object
-   array
-   function
-   map
-   set
-   (and more)
