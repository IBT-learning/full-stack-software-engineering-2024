# HTML & CSS Final Project

Over the course of this program you will develop your own blogging web app. Eventually a user will be able to log into the app, create a profile, make posts, and see other people's profiles and posts. It is up to you whether this app will have a theme (such as a recipe sharing site, etc) or focus on particular kinds of content. However, do not plan for special features outside of the ability to create and edit a profile, and create and edit a blog post with or without photos.

The first phase of this will be to build the HTML prototype. You will not be beholden to this prototype, you may decide to make changes to it over time. This is just a starting place to build from.

Please keep your first draft of this very simple! This is not the time to play with animations or fancy visual tricks, because it is hard to predict how those things will work with the interactivity we will build in the future. Stick to a clean design with a simple layout and visually pleasing colors.

Also, don't spend too much time coming up with content for the blog posts. Feel free to use lorem ipsum, copy wikipedia articles, song lyrics, knock knock jokes, or anything else you want to use as content. It doesn't have to be in English!

### Project setup

Create a new directory inside your code folder. Place all the files related to this project, including any images you may use, inside it.

You will make two web pages, so each page will be a separate html file. I suggest styling them both with the same CSS file. If you like, you may additionally add separate CSS files for each page, so you may need up to three total CSS files.

### Requirements

#### Both pages

Both pages must have

-   mobile-first responsive designs with at least mobile and desktop versions
-   layouts using grid and/or flexbox
-   a matching color scheme (I recommend taking the time to use a color palette generator to come up with something nice)
-   use at least one custom font (from Google Fonts or any other source)

#### Home page

This will be the landing page for the site. Assume the user is logged in.

The page should include at least navigation to the user profile, and several recent blog posts from different users. Each blog post should have:

-   a timestamp
-   a username
-   text (either the full post or the first line, etc)

#### User Profile page

This page will have some kind of bio. You decide what information is stored in the bio, it may be just one line, or responses to several questions/prompts, or a long bio, or anything else. It must also include a profile photo!

In addition to the bio, include several of the user's most recent posts. (I won't notice or care whether these match the ones from the home page, the content is just a placeholder!)

### Extra challenges (optional):

-   make some of the posts have images in them
-   give each post a small user icon (such as a photo thumbnail) that is different for each user
-   give the current user's posts an edit icon
    -   not all of the posts should be from the same user, so decide who the currently logged in user is
-   include a tablet version as well as the mobile and desktop versions
