                        We wake up with a ton of stuff floating around in our minds.
                        We need to channel that energy and get it out. 
                        Morning Pages act as a ‘brain dump’ that will clear your mind to focus on other things.
                        Whether it’s the small distracting thoughts that can take our attention or bigger,
                        more challenging issues that can at times hijack our thoughts,
                        Morning Pages allow us to “dump” all the “stuff”, making way for more constructive and creative thinking.
