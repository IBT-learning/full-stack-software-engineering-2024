# CSS Assignment #1: Flexbox

#### Project setup

Start by copying (not moving!) the files from this folder, [index.html](index.html) and [style.css](style.css), into an assignment folder inside your code folder. Open the HTML file with your Live Server, and then start editing the CSS to meet the requirements you see on the page.

#### Requirements:

Follow the instructions on the page, and align the items as described using _only_ flexbox properties. You will need to use both `flex container` and `flex item` properties.

#### Tips:

-   The page will refresh every time you save. To prevent having to scroll on each save, you can "comment out" the sections at the top of the HTML as you finish them. Remember to remove the comments before you turn it in!
